# Introduction to Programming Mindset

Writing code is a small part of what developers do. Most of the work involves
solving abstract problems. Not only do you need a learner’s mindset, but a
programmer's mindset. This mindset is an asset that will benefit you in various
ways in the long run. You'll need to learn to read and understand code, pay
attention to detail, and learn how to solve problems in a logical, coordinated
fashion. In this section, we'll to give you tools and tasks that will help you
start solving problems in code.

We'll review these topics as well as discuss the following:

* How to fork and clone GitHub repositories
* Sharing code solutions or solve tests from scratch
* Duplicating other organizations' repositories with "git fork"
* Identifying merge conflicts
* Resolving merge conflicts
* Pushing `git` branches
* Creating `git` branches
* Merging `git` branches
* Setting up your local environment on a Mac without `Learn`

Remember, learning how to program is more than just that knowing how to code.
The rest is knowing how to learn, how to ask questions, how to find resources
and how to solve problems. Programming is a skill and a craft. This means anyone
can learn it, and one best learns it through practice.  It's a power that's
accessible to  everyone who wants to learn. Over the next several lessons, we'll
break down each step of the process and give you the skills you need to become a
programmer who can accomplish whatever they set their mind to.
